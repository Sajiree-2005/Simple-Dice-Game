# Simple-Dice-Game

Dicee is a simple web-based dice game where two players roll dice, and the winner is determined based on the higher roll. The page is designed to display the results of both players' rolls and announce the winner or a draw.

## Features

- **Dynamic Image Display:** The dice images update dynamically based on the random number rolled.
- **Winner Display:** The game displays the winner (Player 1 or Player 2) or if the game is a draw.
- **Responsive Layout:** The game interface is designed to work on various screen sizes, providing a simple and engaging experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Provides the structure for the game layout.
- **CSS:** Used to style the page, including the dice and game interface.
- **JavaScript:** Handles the random dice roll logic and updates the page dynamically based on the roll results.
